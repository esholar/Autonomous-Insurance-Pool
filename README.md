# Decentralized Autonomous Insurance Pool (DAIP)

A blockchain-based insurance platform that enables automated risk assessment, policy management, and collective risk sharing through decentralized governance.

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Insurance Pool creates a self-governing insurance ecosystem where risks are collectively shared and managed through smart contracts. The system automates underwriting, claims processing, and pool management while enabling token holders to participate in governance decisions.

    - Machine learning integration
    - Real-time risk updates
    - Multi-factor assessment
    - Dynamic pricing
    - Risk categorization

### 2. Policy Contract
